## LMV_Portfolio 
### Personal Experimental Portfolio
*Creative work & code under exclusive copyright by default* 

> *Fulfilling a high school goal from a near decade ago that collected dust while I was away at college...* <br>
>
> I've picked up more coding & programming experience since then.. hopefully, I can execute the ambitious designs I envision now. With renewed passion and freed-up time to finally pick up where I left off, I plan to document my progress and inspire others to kickstart their site goals!
> 
> **My portfolio site will publish self-made content *(unless otherwise stated)* from the following domains:** <br>
> **Design | Dance | Videography | Photography | Art | Music** <br>
>
> This portfolio isn't about perfection. It's about the process. The process of being inspired from an idea of my own or another and arduously going through trial-and-error to take it to fruition. I want to show my growth by growing out of my comfort zone as I experiment with various concepts.. Without the pressure and labels of attention, likes, and judgement. This is my world, hidden in plain sight. Found by whomever is curious enough to.<br>
>
> For most content, I aim to show the Behind-the-Scenes footage and/or breakdown of how the final results came to be. I want to encourage others that they can achieve a seemingly complex result by simplying achieving it step-by-step. Harder goals just take more steps and time to understand and achieve them, no? And if it takes us longer, then don't forget to be proud of the road you've paved behind you. Finished or unfinished, progress is progress! You'll have come out having learned more than you did yesterday :) we got this!
